# Web Design Homework - 





Welcome to the global weather study. This analysis shows the effects on temperature, humidity, wind speed and 
cloudiness at various latitudes across the globe. The analysis used current weather data on October 29, 2020 
from 1113 cities selected randomly at various locations and distances from the equator in the northern and 
southern hemisphere. To ensure a representative and equally weighted sample of cities in the Northern and Southern hemispheres
 and across continents, the globe was divided into four quadrants. Using Python, 400 cities were randomly generated in each 
quadrant. The data was cleaned to remove null values resulting in 1113 cities for the analysis. Weather data was obtained by 
using OpenWeatherMap, which is an open-source API. Each key performance indicator (maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness and 
wind speed) analysis has its own web page which shows a graph and an analysis. This web pages can access using the “plot” drop down menu. 
There is a web page with all four graphs for comparison which can be access by clicking on “Comparison” on the navigation bar. 
The “Data” link on the navigation bar goes to a web page which provides the entire data set used for the analysis. Clicking on “Latitude” 
in the upper left navigation bar will bring you back to the home page. I hope you enjoy this site and analysis.
